# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Assignment-
This repository contains a README file describing how I get, clean and manipulate data to generate a workable data set.  In this case accelerometer and gyroscope data from Samsung smartphones was used.

The objective of this project is to create a R script to get, download, manipulate and create a new dataset that is tidy (using descriptive varibale names, and each column is a variable). In addition the dataset is organized so that it will be eassy to review adn work with it.

A cookbook with all the steps is provided and R script used in this proejct is found in this repository as well
